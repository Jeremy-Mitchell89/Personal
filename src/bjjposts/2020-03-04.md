Reviewed the armbar variations from 03-02 class since they were very effective and high percentage but added one sweep from the same position

Starting with control of your opponent’s arm just like the previous class but then you break your guard and shrimp to your right side using your left foot to push off the opponent’s hip. reach under the back of your opponent’s knee to grab ahold of their leg. Swing your left leg out and chop your opponent’s leg to help sweep them over to the left side. Simultaneously lift up with your right arm from behind their knee and if you can push under their armpit with your other leg to also push them over. Roll over on top of them and end up in mount, sometimes i ended up still having control of the arm for an easy armbar, otherwise it’s an easy high mount.
