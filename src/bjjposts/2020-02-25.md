---

Starting from standard side control with one arm under the head and the other under the armpit we transition to the scarf hold. Pull the opponents near side arm up into your armpit and pinch it firmly with your arm. Find the opponents elbow and cup that before making the next move. Kick right leg through and up towards your opponents head to get to the scarf hold.

To start the armbar throw your left leg over to the other side of your opponents head and grab your foot with your right hand to secure the position. You should still have the opponents arm firmly in your control so you can put pressure on it and get the tap.

The other scenario is if the opponent blocks your step over with his arm. Quickly grab the arm used to block and put it to the mat. get your legs back onto the other side for stability and get the americana.
