Start with Opponent in your closed guard. Opponent stands up to break your guard and it breaks. Squeeze knees together and grab both ankles. opponent falls backwards onto their butt. If you are able to grab the opponents cuff while they are going down you can use it to pull yourself up and get top mount.

The more likely scenario is you will miss the grab on the cuff and they will land on thier with you also on your back. Both players sit up and the opponent will likely attempt to use a cross grip on your lapel. whichever side the opponent grab, grab the lapel hand from the top and hold it there. post your other hand behind yourself(not too far away) and swing the leg opposite your post hand over the opponent. From there you will have an opportunity for and arm bar, if that doesnt work you can use your weight and sit on your opponent while leaning back to secure the armbar(leg must be in place on the side of the opponents head)
