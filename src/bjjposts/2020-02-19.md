Did a couple of variations of the scissor sweep. The main two were performed exactly like the video below so i wont bother describing it.

Third was a little more elaborate. when you are in the scissor position with your opponents cross collar and cuff you switch your grip off the cuff you control and over to the other cuff. You can pull that forward to force your opponent forward and sit up on the elbow that is pulling the cuff. The other arm reaches over and grabs the armpit so you can pull your opponent onto your leg and flip them over your body to end up in side control.
