This seemed like a fundamental and extrememly useful set of techniques that I was having an easy time understanding.

From closed guard grip your opponents left sleeve and swim your right arm under the opponents right arm to cup their left elbow. Put your left leg on the opponents hip and thrust your hips up to help pull their arm down to the ground on your right side. Hug the opponent and keep them tight, you should have their right arm up on your shoulder right beside your head. switch your grip to have your arms crossed and grabbing your own elbows(I dream of genie pose?) roll the opponets arm right up beside your head and pull down on their elbow for the armbar. I had to straighten my body to get the longer lever before applying pressure to actually get it to work.

From the end of the previous Armbar if the opponent yanks the arm you are trying to armbar out of your control you should still have the other arm trapped at your side which you should hold in place with your right elbow. using your left hand to help if needed throw your left leg over your opponents head for the easy armbar on the trapped arm. This was super tight and did not require much pressure at all.
