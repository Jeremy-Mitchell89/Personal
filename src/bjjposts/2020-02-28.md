Tonight was a slightly different format for class. We started with the single leg takedown which transitioned into the concept of always looking for wrist grabs.

After the opponent shoots in for the single leg grab on your lead leg their right wrist(toward the inside of your leg) will be available to grab with your right hand. from there you can make the figure four with your other hand. Step forward with your free leg if possible and sit backwards which forces your opponent to forward roll and end on their back. With the wrist still locked up get off your back and up to your knees for the kimura.

The next portion of class also isnt really a technique but more of a concept. With your opponent in your closed guard you can grab the opponents lapel and scoot up to your butt with your other arm posted until your arm that is grabbing the lapel is straight. From there your opponent will be easy to keep at a distance.
