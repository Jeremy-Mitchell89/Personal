Taking a similar idea to the Liftv1 project and going farther with it. Looking to get into front end frameworks I decided to use React
for this project.

This project was bootstrapped using Create React App and uses several third party components/libraries such as Redux, Redux-Thunk, Moment.js, Downshift,
Axios, and Sass

This app was hosted on Heroku/Mlab but since newer versions of the same app have been released it has been taken down.

Key Technologies used:
• RESTful API
• Node
• Express
• Authentication using passport/jwt-decode
• React - using Create React App as a starter
• Redux
• Sass
• MongoDB - using Mongoose to connect to express server
