Using the open MovieDB.org I created a front end to display different datapoints offered by the api such as Now playing, Coming soon, and trending movies.

After Liftv1 was finished I kept hearing about the different frontend frameworks; this is my attempt to dip my toes into the pool that is React. It uses a package
named Axios to simplify the api calls and uses react-router to do the client side routing.

The project was created using create-react-app and hosted on Github pages using the gh-pages package.
