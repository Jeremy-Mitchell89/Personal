This was the first "real" application that I built. It is a simple tracker that I used to log my workouts. I wanted something a little more in-line with my
personal preferences than anything I could find free and available.

It uses JavaScript with EJS as the view engine and Node/express on the backend with mongodb for data persistence.

This app was hosted on Heroku/Mlab but since newer versions of the same app have been released it has been taken down.

Key Technologies used:
• RESTful API
• Node
• Express
• Authentication using passport
• EJS
• Bootstrap
• JQuery
• MongoDB - using Mongoose to connect to express server
